### FOMC tweets
Exact time of release (hh:mm) of FOMC statements from the automated tweets sent out by @federalreserve until 2022

May be used instead of relying on the scheduled release time on the FOMC website as delays of a few minutes are common, particularly before 2015. There are numerous inconsistencies between the time of release of the statements voted by the FOMC, the time at which the statements are actually released and the time of release indicated on the press conference summaries (press conferences are held every two meetings with exceptions).
